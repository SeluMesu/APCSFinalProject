					<p class="body-par third">Facial Recognition consumes image from from image, video or real person.
						The image that is consumed, an algorithm reads the geometer of face such as forehead, chin,
						nose, distance
						of eyes. The
						algorithm identifies facial landmarks — the system identifies 68 of them — that are key to
						distinguishing
						your
						face. The geometry form the image compares with database faces geometry. The
						algorithm
						determine and shows
						the match it found.
					</p>
					<h3 class="title third">Privacy Concern</h3>
					<p class="body-par third">
						A privacy concern is that to increase the accuracy of facial recognition companies collect
						customers data.
						Customers do
						not have access to thiers data and don’t know what companies could used it for. For instance
						Amazon launches
						grocery
						store that doesn't use human cashier. Everything is done using facial recognition. Amazon can
						use customers
						data to sale
						products.
